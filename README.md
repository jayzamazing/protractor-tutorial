#Protractor Tutorial

## What is in this project?
This project is just a play ground for me to be able to play with protractor and jasmine.

## How to run?
> For now this section assumes that you have installed protractor globally. Basic instructions on how to install protractor will follow later.

1. In a terminal window type in "webdriver-manager start".
2. In a separate terminal window type "protractor conf.js --suite NAMEOFSUITE"
